  <h1>Programming Language</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Any program is a set of instructions given to a computer to perform a specific operation. Or computer is a computational device which is used to process the data under the control of a computer program. While executing the program, raw data is processed into a desired output format. These computer programs are written in a programming language which are high level languages.
High level languages are nearly human languages which are more complex than the computer understandable language which are called machine language, or low level language.</p>
<p>A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming. Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a “binary.” Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.” Each language, from C Language to Python, has its own distinct features, though many times there are commonalities between programming languages. These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information. For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them in ascending order, chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors.
There are dozens of programming languages used in the industry today. We've compiled overviews some of the most important, relevant and in-demand of these languages.</p>
  <p>Like we have different languages to communicate with each other, likewise, we have different languages like C, C++, C#, Java, python, etc. to communicate with the computers. The computer only understands binary language (the language of 0’s and 1’s) also called machine-understandable language or low-level language.</p>
